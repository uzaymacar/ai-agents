Hybrid Drones Ltd was able to fundraise enough to allow me to pursue the technology full time on salary immediately following my graduation. I then singlehandedly designed and built a working technology demonstrator within 6 months on a tiny budget. This demonstrator served its purpose by demonstrating 110kg+ lift capability with an aircraft mass of only 81 kg fully fueled, piloted by myself also. The technology was patented and we received extensive interest from the military-industrial complex, allowing us to fundraise further. As of writing this, I am working on a HydraXL production model with even greater lift capability, improved ergonomics and build quality to meet the military customer's needs.\\n\\nI have also developed an autonomous sense and avoid demonstrator using an Nvidia Jetson computer running tensorflow machine learning models, and a computer program to optimise and predict the performance of hybrid jet electric drones in any configuration and various scenarios.

The company we confounded then restructured into Hybrid Drones Ltd after his death of which I am a director. Hybrid Drones Ltd was able to fundraise enough to allow me to pursue the technology full time on salary immediately following my graduation. I then singlehandedly designed and built a working technology demonstrator within 6 months on a tiny budget. This demonstrator served its purpose by demonstrating 110kg+ lift capability with an aircraft mass of only 81 kg fully fueled, piloted by myself also. The technology was patented and we received extensive interest from the military-industrial complex, allowing us to fundraise further. As of writing this, I am working on a HydraXL production model with even greater lift capability, improved ergonomics and build quality to meet the military customer's needs.\\n\\nI have also developed an autonomous sense and avoid demonstrator using an Nvidia Jetson computer running tensorflow machine learning models, and a computer program to optimise and predict the performance of hybrid jet electric drones in any configuration and various scenarios. The latter is used extensively to make data-driven design decisions; the best kind of design decisions.\"\", 'company': {'employeeCountRange': {'start': 2, 'end': 10}, 'industries': ['Airlines/Aviation']}, 'title': 'Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder', 'region': 'urn:li:fs_region:(gb,0)', 'companyUrn': 'urn:li:fs_miniCompany:42417133', 'companyLogoUrl': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQGuDG1ko62TcQ/company-logo_'}]\"\n",

      "Read more in our blog post: https://lnkd.in/gcVthRmm\",\"Today, we're announcing the Claude 3 model family, which sets new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks. The family includes three state-of-the-art models in ascending order of capability: Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus. Each successive model offers increasingly powerful performance, allowing users to select the optimal balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opus and Sonnet are now available to use in claude.ai and the Claude API which is now generally available in 159 countries. Haiku will be available soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opus, our most intelligent model, outperforms its peers on most of the common evaluation benchmarks for AI systems, and exhibits near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks – leading the frontier of general intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haiku is the fastest and most cost-effective model on the market for its intelligence category. For the vast majority of workloads, Sonnet is 2x faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1. Whereas Opus delivers similar speeds to Claude 2 and 2.1, with much higher levels of intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Claude 3 models have sophisticated vision capabilities on par with other leading models. They demonstrate a strong aptitude for understanding a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs and technical diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Claude 3 model family has advanced on key measures of biological knowledge, cyber-related knowledge, and autonomy compared to previous models, it remains at AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) per our Responsible Scaling Policy.\n",
      "\n",
