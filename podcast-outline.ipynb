      "I aim this to be a weekly ~40-minute interview-style remote podcast with subject matter experts, released on YouTube with LinkedIn coverage. It’ll be casual (and hopefully fun) interviews where we tackle challenging questions on AI agents, aimed at a general audience but also equally valuable for technical listeners.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few topics that we’ll cover across episodes include:\n",
      "1) What are AI agents? How do we define agency in AI?\n",
      "2) Real-world case studies and practical applications of AI agents. Here, experts can also share or demo their own tools and products.\n",
      "3) What does the rise of AI agents mean for businesses? Developers? Academia? Society?\n",
      "4)The future of work with AI agents\n",
      "5) How can everyday people start using AI Agents to make their life better?\n",
      "6) Spotlighting recent advancements (e.g., Claude Computer Use) and trends (e.g., CrewAI)\n",
      "7) Evaluation metrics and strategies for AI agents\n",
      "8) Multi-agent collaboration architectures\n",
      "9) Role of memory, context, and human-in-the-loop in AI agents\n",
      "10) Ethical considerations in autonomous decision-making\n",
      "11) Practical challenges, insights, and stories of building AI agents and startups in today’s world\n",
      "12) Anything else you think is worth discussing!\n",

      "For guests who’ll come on the podcast, I’ll share a separate one-pager podcast outline document where I’ll list a few potential topics we can discuss. Guests can add to this document any questions or topics that they’d like me to bring up in the interview. The interviews don’t have to be pre-scripted (better if not), but also they don’t have to be completely blind too. If you have things you’d like to share, demo, or bring up, please do add it to the document! \n",

      "Content: arXiv:2401.13138 arXiv author ID Visibility into AI Agents Information about where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as visibility, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents: agent identifiers, real-time monitoring, and activity logging. Further work into understanding the measures and mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the governance of AI agents.
