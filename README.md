# AI Agents

This is a repository collecting various AI agents I've worked on.

Some of them I use frequently and other I programmed for fun and learning.

They cover a wide range of **frameworks** (e.g. LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI, Ollama, etc.), **models** (e.g. Anthropic, DeepSeek R1, etc.), **tools** (e.g. YouTube API, LinkedIn API, etc.), and **topics** (e.g. video summarization, podcast outline,reasoning).

I hope you find them useful. 

You can find all of the agents in the `agents/` directory.
